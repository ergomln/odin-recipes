        <p>TThis honey chicken recipe was given to me by a friend. I've used this recipe for years, and my family requests it often. It's a light meal that everyone will enjoy. Serve with steamed rice.

        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>5 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
            <li>⅓ cup light brown sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>6 green onions, chopped, divided</li>
            <li>4 cups hot cooked brown rice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add beef and cook, stirring and crumbling into small pieces until browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain excess grease.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in garlic, ginger, and sesame oil and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Stir in soy sauce, brown sugar, and red pepper. Cook until beef absorbs some sauce, about 7 minutes. Add 1/2 of chopped green onions.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve over hot cooked rice; garnish with sesame seeds and remaining green onions.
            </li>
        </ol>
